Acceptance checklist
- [x] Local run works with Flask and UI matches provided HTML/CSS/JS (copied verbatim).
- [x] /api/scan implements login/logout with forced logout on same scanner.
- [x] /api/worker/<token_id> returns worker state.
- [x] /api/admin/upload_operations parses CSV/XLSX and validates columns.
- [x] /api/admin/upload_po creates 12 bundles by distribution algorithm.
- [x] ESP32 example posts to /api/scan and renders basic TFT text (serial fallback).
- [x] Test harness simulates multiple scanners.
- [x] Unit tests cover scan flow, forced logout, PO distribution â€” all passing in CI locally.

Notes on design decisions
- UI fidelity guaranteed by using your files unchanged in templates/static.
- Timestamps stored in UTC; API returns ISO-8601.
- SQLite used for simplicity; schema in app/models.py.
